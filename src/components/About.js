              As a recent graduate with a <b>Master of Science</b> in{" "}
              <b>Computer Science</b> from the <b>University of Georgia</b>,
              I‚Äôve built strong technical foundations across{" "}

              , and core areas like <i>Algorithm Design</i> and{" "}
              <i>Database Management</i>. My final project focused on research
              in <b>Affective Computing</b>, where I conducted an extensive
              survey of recent advances to highlight innovative AI
              methodologies, dataset considerations, and key gaps in developing
              more empathetic and inclusive emotion-aware systems.{" "}

              Previously at <b>IBM</b>, I led the development of scalable web
              applications and drove UI modernization for enterprise cloud
              solutions, enhancing performance and user experience across
              critical systems. At <b>Whatfix</b>, I partnered directly with
              global clients to integrate tailored digital adoption solutions,
              streamlining workflows and improving platform engagement.

              When I'm not channeling my efforts into improving technology, I
              find solace in the world of <b>painting</b> and <b>digital art</b>
              , immersing myself in the creative flow. I actively share my
              creative work and ideas on my art page, where I‚Äôve built a growing
              community of followers and collaborated with major art brands.

              Driven by a blend of engineering rigor and creative instinct, I‚Äôm
              excited to contribute to impactful products and craft technology
